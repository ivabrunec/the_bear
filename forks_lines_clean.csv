INTERVIEWER:,1
So as you've been,1
coaching over the years,1
what would you say are the,1
most important,1
 uh,1
 lessons  ,1
of leadership,1
that you've learned?  ,1
COACH K:,1
The very first thing is that,1
you know,1
in order to get better,1
you change limits.  ,1
And when you change limits,1
you're gonna look bad,1
and you're gonna fail.  ,1
And at West Point,1
I learned that failure,1
was never a destination.   ,1
In other words,1
when you are knocked back,1
you know,1
 figure out why,1
and then,1
 then change.   ,1
The other thing is that you're,1
not gonna get there alone.   ,1
You know,1
 be on a team.   ,1
You know,1
 surround yourself,1
with good people   ,1
and learn how to listen.   ,1
You're not gonna learn,1
with you just talking.   ,1
And when you do talk,1
converse,1
don't make excuses.   ,1
Figure out the solution.   ,1
And you don't have to,1
figure it out yourself.   ,1
I always wanted to be,1
a part of a team   ,1
and obviously I wanted,1
to lead that team.   ,1
You know,1
 what a,1
what an interesting life   ,1
it is to be a leader.   ,1
That's something.   ,1
(alarm beeping)   ,2
(beeping continues,2
 stops)   ,2
(sighs)   ,2
(alarm chirps)   ,2
(engine starts)   ,2

his whole first fuckin' day?   ,3
First week.,3

GARRETT:,3
First week is forks.   ,3
And if you get lucky,3
you make it to spoons.   ,3
Can we chill out,3

please?   ,3
How long am I,3
supposed to be here for?,3
A week.,3
Alright.   ,3
You want me to fork,3
I'll fork.   ,3
I'm not gonna give cousin,3
the satisfaction   ,3
of coming home early.   ,3
I can do my time,3
standing on one foot.   ,3
So let me get this straight.   ,3
He's punishing you,3
by making you work   ,3
at the best restaurant,3
in the world?   ,3
Yep. He's punishing me,3
for being ancillary.   ,3
GARRETT: Great. Let me,3
give you some purpose then.   ,3
Dry those properly.   ,3
You see those streaks?,3
That's bad.   ,3
Thanks,3
 Junior.   ,3
Where's the boss?,3
Which one?,3
Big boss. Capo. Terry.   ,3
Chef Terry is always watching.   ,3
(Richie scoffs)   ,3

Yo. Garrett. Chef.   ,5
I've been doing this forever.    ,5
Can I... wash dishes,5
or something?    ,5
No,5
 we got the best,5
dishwashers in the world.    ,5
You're just gonna,5
slow 'em down.    ,5
That wasn't clean.    ,5
I've been doing this,5
for nine hours.    ,5
I think I know what's clean.    ,5
I'm telling you,5
that's not clean.    ,5
That was not clean either.,5
Please do them properly--    ,5
Yo. They're goddamn forks.    ,5
Outside.    ,5
GARRETT:,5
Do you think this is,5
below you or something?    ,5
(scoffs)    ,5
Man,5
 I think I'm    years old,5
polishing forks.    ,5
No one is asking you,5
to be here.    ,5
I don't think anybody,5
remembers your name.    ,5
Nice try.    ,5
You think I don't know,5
how hard it is    ,5
hiring people since COVID?    ,5
We don't have that problem.    ,5
You really drink,5
this Kool-Aid,5
 huh?    ,5
Yeah,5
 I do.    ,5
Why?,5
Because I love this,5
 Richie.    ,5
I love this so much,5
 dude.    ,5
Did you know that,5
when this restaurant,5
opened  12  years ago,5
it won the best restaurant,5
in the world the same year?    ,5
It's retained three stars    ,5
because we have,5
a waiting list that's long.    ,5
Five thousand people waiting,5
at any given moment long.    ,5
Do you see their faces,5
when they walk in here?    ,5
How stoked they are to see us    ,5
and how stoked we have to be,5
to serve them?    ,5
It takes 200 people,5
to keep this place in orbit.    ,5
And at any given moment,5
one of those people    ,5
that is waiting in line,5
gets to eat here.    ,5
They get to spend their time,5
and their money here.    ,5
I'm sorry,5
 bro,5
but we need to have some forks,5
without streaks in them.    ,5
Every day here,5
is the freaking Super Bowl.    ,5
You don't have to drink,5
the Kool-Aid,5
 Richie.    ,5
I just need you to respect me.,5
I need you to respect the staff.    ,5
I need you,5
to respect the diners.    ,5
And I need you,5
to respect yourself.    ,5
I can do respect.    ,5
Lovely. I'll see you inside.    ,5

Tonight's PONs include    ,6
Kimberly Foxx,6
district attorney,6
of the city of Chicago.    ,6
We have Maurice Cheeks...,6

Person of note.    ,6
MANAGER: ...as well as    ,6

Bo Burnham.    ,6
On  29 at 7: 15 ,6
we have Tim and Jill Perry.    ,6
They're both,6
Elmhurst High School teachers.    ,6

it's always been her dream to,6
dine at a three-star restaurant.    ,6

 quote,6
"""Saving up for this.""    ",6
I wanna go,6
above and beyond tonight.    ,6
Every supplement,6
and caviar,6
 please.    ,6
A tour of the kitchen,6
a champagne tour,6
in the gallery as well.    ,6
And,6
 guys,6
 we're not gonna,6
let these people spend a dollar.    ,6
Do not drop a check.    ,6
I wanna blow,6
their fuckin minds.    ,6
ALL: Chef.    ,6
MANAGER: Last thing,6
still,6
 no one is,6
owning up to the smudge.    ,6
I wanna clarify that it's not,6
so much the smudge,6
but rather the fact that no one    ,6
is taking responsibility,6
for the smudge.    ,6
We're not children.,6
It's okay to make mistakes.    ,6
We can smudge things,6
but we need to own up to them    ,6
with immediacy,6
integrity,6
 and honesty.    ,6
Does anyone wanna talk,6
any more about the smudge?    ,6
Couple menu updates.    ,6
Uh,6
 per Chef Terry    ,6
the duck roulade,6
will now be served    ,6
with a,6
 uh,6
Concord grape reduction    ,6
instead of the cherry.    ,6
We're gonna be adding,6
a dish to the menu.    ,6
That's gonna be the six-course,6
a Dungeness crab,6
with grapefruit and champagne.    ,6
Did you talk about the smudge?,6
Only A lot.,6
I know this sounds ridiculous.    ,6
I am aware that I've had to say,6
"the word f*cking ""smudge""    ",6
20 times,6
in the last two days,6
but we had to reset,6
the plate with the smudge    ,6
because the persimmon glaze,6
was smudged,6
which fucked the set because,6
we had to take it to a four-top,6
which meant we have to match,6
the other three plates    ,6
to the smudge plate,6
which cost us 45 seconds.    ,6
Forty-seven seconds.,6
Forty-seven seconds.,6
Now,6
 if you cost us,6
that kind of time,6
you sure as shit,6
better own up to it,6
because we sure as shit,6
are gonna pay for it.    ,6
Now get back to work!    ,6
fuck you,6
 Garrett!    ,6
Yes,6

" ""Yes""    ",12
Oh,12
 oh,12
 oh    ,12
Oh,12
 oh,12
 oh-oh    ,12
Cause we were both young,12
when I first saw you    ,12
(alarm beeps,13
 stops)    ,13
RICHIE:,13
Yo,13
 let me ask you,13
am I the oldest stage    ,13
that's ever staged here?    ,13
GARRETT:,13
I don't know,13
 dude. Probably.    ,13
How old are you?,13
-That's an HR violation.    ,13
-You're not supposed to ask--,13
fuck off,13
 Garrett.    ,13
How old are you?,13
-I'm   ,13
 dude.    ,13
Thirty.,13
-And you're like a chef?    ,13
what?,13
RICHIE: you like to cook?,13
you like,13
 uh,13
 rattle,13
the pots and pans?,13
GARRETT: no,13
 I don't like--    ,13
No,13
 no,13
 I don't like to cook.    ,13
Then why you work,13
at a restaurant?    ,13
GARRETT:,13
I don't know,13
 man,13
 because...    ,13
A couple of years ago,13
I had a drinking problem.    ,13
And I got sober.    ,13
I'm good now,13
 you know,13
like I feel healthy    ,13
and I'm happy and I'm grateful.    ,13
And through that experience,13
I learned about,13
acts of service and...    ,13
I just like being able to serve,13
other people now.    ,13
You know?    ,13
Service.,13
GARRETT: Yeah.,13
You know,13
 I used to work,13
for this guy who used to say    ,13
that taking care of people,13
at the highest level    ,13
was like working at a hospital.    ,13
You know,13
like it was like medi--    ,13
Okay. That's a little much.    ,13
I'm just saying,13
I think that's why restaurants    ,13
and hospitals use,13
the same word,13
" ""hospitality.""    ",13
Yeah,13
 no shit.    ,13
Hospitality.    ,13
I wanted to say thanks,13
for a fun week,13
 man.,13
It was dope.    ,13
Thank you,13
 my man.,13
It was fun.    ,13
GARRETT:,13
Yeah. Um,13
 you know,13
we have a new stage,13
coming tomorrow morning,13
and,13
 um,13
 I think we're all,13
really gonna miss you here.    ,13
Aah.    ,13
fuck,13
 man.    ,13
I'm just gettin' the hang of it.    ,13
GARRETT:,13
I know,13
 I know. I know.    ,13
We have one more,13
shift tomorrow,13
 but,13
 yeah.    ,13
Damn.    ,13
Let me ask you,13
like,13
 what if,13
 uh...    ,13
I mean,13
 I don't know,13
what the situation is like,13
you know,13
 but...    ,13
if something opens up,13
you know...    ,13
Richie.    ,13
That'd be awesome,13
but you know it's not my call.    ,13
Alright.    ,13
I mean,13
I got another job anyway.    ,13
I am needed elsewhere.    ,13
Thanks,13

(sighs)    ,14
(exhales)    ,14
(cell phone ringing)    ,14
Yo,14
 cousin,14

-What's going on?    ,14
CARMY:,14

do something--    ,14
-FAK: I'm recalibrating.,14
-I'm watching Fak recalibrate.    ,14
Yeah,14
 I'm recalibrating.    ,14
We,14

Another one,14

CARMY:,14
Yeah,14

We have one more shot.    ,14
RICHIE: How bad is it,14

It's fuckin' bad--    ,14
(screams) Goddammit.,14

FAK: Okay,14

CARMY: Please be careful.,14
It's bad,14

RICHIE: What do I need?    ,14

I don't need anything.    ,14
Just calling,14
to tell you I'm done.,14
CARMY: Yes,14

No,14

How'd that go?    ,14
Bro,14

RICHIE: It was fine.    ,14
(Fak groans)    ,14
Yo,14

What... To get rid of you?,14
Fak. Fak. Fak!    ,14

RICHIE: Yes.,14

-I-I-I sent you there--,14
RICHIE: no,14

You sent me there    ,14

Make me look like,14

You're the fucking jagoff,14
Carmen.    ,14
What the fuck you talkin' about?    ,14
(screaming) fuck! fuck!,14
Yo! Fuckin' Christ!    ,14

CARMY: Just fuckin' stop.,14
-FAK: Stop!    ,14
Yeah,14

CARMY: Take A break.,14
FAK: I actually think,14
I hurt myself.    ,14
(alarm beeping)    ,15
(water running)    ,15
Um...    ,15
(clock ticking)    ,15
(footsteps approaching)    ,15
Hey,15
 I'm about,15
to go over staff reviews.    ,15

Oh,15

I gotta finish this last bin.    ,15
'Kay.    ,15
We loved having you here.,15
Thanks for everything.    ,15
Thanks,15
 Chef Jess.    ,15
(sighs deeply)    ,15
You know where the polish is?,15
That bullshit keeps moving.    ,15
Try that drawer over there.    ,15
What are you making?    ,15
I'm just peeling mushrooms,15
for the lamb des tournelles.    ,15
Peeling mushrooms?    ,15
Yeah. It's just,15
a nice little fun detail.    ,15
So when the diners see it,15
they know that someone    ,15
spent a lot of time,15
on their dish.    ,15
Do you wanna have a go?    ,15
Alright.    ,15
Okay,15
 so hold it like this.    ,15
Mm-Hmm.,15
Knife at 1300,15
Grab the end,15
and just peel like that.    ,15
So slowly.    ,15
Yeah.    ,15
Thirteen hundred,15
 huh?    ,15
TERRY: Yeah.,15
Did you serve?,15
Dad did.,15
RICHIE: Yeah. Same.,15
Staff sergeant.    ,15
Corporal.    ,15
A lot of standards.    ,15
Yeah.    ,15
Turns out,15
 I like standards.    ,15
(Richie scoffs)    ,15
(Richie sighs)    ,15
Did you move around a lot?    ,15
Yeah. You?    ,15
I know Carmen.,15
RICHIE: Yeah,15
 I know.    ,15
I'm sorry,15
that he pulled a favor.    ,15
Not at all.,15
I don't do favors.    ,15
-How's that?,15
-That's great.    ,15
can I do another one?,15
TERRY: Yes,15
 please do.    ,15
So why do you do this?    ,15
(laughs) I do it for a living.    ,15
No,15
 but,15
 like,15
 don't you,15
have stages that do this shit?    ,15
Yeah,15
 well,15
 I like,15
starting the day with this.    ,15
Why?,15
TERRY: Respect. Feels attached.,15
I think time spent doing this,15
is time well spent.    ,15
RICHIE: Time well spent.    ,15
That's what it's all about?    ,15
Yeah,15
 I think so.    ,15
When did that start?    ,15
Oh,15
 I st... I tried to open,15
a giant place years ago.    ,15
I had all these accolades.,15
I was younger,15
 I was on fire.    ,15
I was arrogant,15
 and,15
 uh...    ,15
I tried to move too fast.    ,15
I couldn't keep the place open,15
and the market crashed,15
and I got killed.    ,15
Public wipeout?    ,15
Oh,15
 yeah.,15
The most public wipeout.    ,15
So how'd this place happen?    ,15
Well,15
 now,15
 that was on my...    ,15
My   th birthday.,15
Hmm.,15
I was out walking all night,15
unemployed,15
 angry,15
 depressed.    ,15
Blaming everybody else,15
for all the time I'd lost    ,15
and the money I'd lost,15
all of it.    ,15
And it was raining.    ,15
And I was walking,15
through Lincoln Park.,15
My phone had died.    ,15
And so I stood under this awning,15
waiting for the rain to stop.    ,15
And I just stood there,15
and stared.    ,15
And eventually the sun came up    ,15
and it turns out,15
I was right there.    ,15
And then I walked,15
'round to the front    ,15
and I saw the sign.    ,15
It was an actual sign.    ,15
It was a restaurant,15
for lease sign.    ,15
Like,15
 um... (clicks tongue)    ,15
-...never too late kinda thing.,15
TERRY: Yeah.,15
Never too late to start over.    ,15
How did you get,15
the money to open?    ,15
Um,15
 well,15
 my dad had died,15
the summer before,15
and only child,15
 my mum sold,15
the house and put it in here.    ,15
Oh. Family business.,15
TERRY: Yeah.,15
You close with your ma?    ,15
Yeah,15
 she's my best friend.,15
You?    ,15
My best friend's ma,15
was like my ma.    ,15
TERRY: Ooh,15
 yeah?    ,15
What about your dad?    ,15
No.,15
Yeah. (laughs),15
Are you close to yours?    ,15
Hmm.,15
Yeah. Yeah,15
 it's funny.    ,15
I learned the most about him,15
when I was packing up his house.    ,15
All his belongings,15
like,15
 his whole life.    ,15
And I found this,15
stash of pocket notebooks    ,15
that he must have taken with him,15
when he was on tour.    ,15
And full of all these details,15
like the palm trees he'd seen,15
or escargot he'd tried.    ,15
Or this time,15
the ocean looked purple.    ,15
And,15
 um,15
 the way,15
he wrote everything,15
it was like a reminder,15
like a...,15
don't forget this moment    ,15
or don't forget this,15
interesting,15
 strange detail.    ,15
Hundreds of these entries.    ,15
JESSICA: Chef Terry?    ,15
And he'd-he'd sign each one off,15
the same way every time.    ,15
Chef?,15
Yes,15
 Chef?    ,15
Arnaud upstairs.    ,15
TERRY:,15
Oh,15
 thank you,15
 Chef.    ,15
Don't be a stranger,15
 Richie.    ,15
Say hi to Carmen for me.    ,15
Yeah,15
 will do.    ,15
TERRY: Thank you.    ,15
He believes in you,15
you know.    ,15
(Richie scoffs)    ,15
What makes you say that?    ,15
He told me.    ,15
He said you're good with people.,15
He's not wrong.    ,15
Nice talking to you,15
 Chef.    ,15
TERRY: Likewise,15
 Chef.    ,15
Uh,15
 ch... Chef?    ,15
Uh,15
 you never said,15
what he signed off with.    ,15
What'd your dad...    ,15
"(""Love Story""",15
